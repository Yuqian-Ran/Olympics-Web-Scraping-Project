From judging to timing to preliminary rounds to finals to the various Olympic records, there is data for every sport and country at the Olympics Games.
We analysis the Summer Olympic Games from three aspects: 
1.	location: the US, UK and China will top the medals tables when it is all over, why these countries are so successful.
2.	history: 
Analyzing the number of Olympic medals won by geographic region by geographic region year reveals the true impact and extent of medal diversification. For example, whilst more countries are winning Olympic medals, how many medals are they capturing compared to traditionally strong Olympic nations? Is their success fairly minor or more pronounced? What are the possible contributing factors to their success in the Olympics? I listed the history of total medals won by the top 13 leading countries. 
3.	different sports: Which countries dominate the 2 traditional sports: athletics and swimming?
4.	gender and age: Have the Olympic games achieved gender equality in competitors? Does age impact the number of medals the athletes can get?
